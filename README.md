## 🏗 USAGE

Run the CLI by typing the following command in your terminal/command prompt. This will generate the password and **copy** it on your clipboard. The only thing you need to do is to **paste** it where you are signing up.

```

## 👨🏻‍💻 AUTHOR

🙋🏻‍♂️ Hola! I am Saad, an undergrad Computer Science student. As a developer I know that how dangerous it is to use same password on every website. So I developed this CLI that can generate random passwords and allow you to save your credentials locally on your computer.
